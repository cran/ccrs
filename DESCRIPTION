Description: Functions for performing Correcting and Clustering response-style-biased preference data (CCRS). The main functions are correct.RS() for correcting for response styles, and ccrs() for simultaneously correcting and content-based clustering. The procedure begin with making rank-ordered boundary data from the given preference matrix using a function called create.ccrsdata(). Then in correct.RS(), the response style is corrected as follows: the rank-ordered boundary data are smoothed by I-spline functions, the given preference data are transformed by the smoothed functions. The resulting data matrix, which is considered as bias-corrected data, can be used for any data analysis methods. If one wants to cluster respondents based on their indicated preferences (content-based clustering), ccrs() can be applied to the given (response-style-biased) preference data, which simultaneously corrects for response styles and clusters respondents based on the contents. Also, the correction result can be checked by plot.crs() function.
